Two of my favorite coding projects are linked to on my coding page and include:

**Jazz Chord Generator**

Create smooth jazz chords and voicings! Just choose a key, what type of chord and which voicings you would like to hear.
My code will color-code the scale degrees and also play the sound of the chord with an ePiano sound.
Read jazzKnowledge.md for the music theory.

**Scale Generator**

Listen to various different types of scales. From the Western `Church modes` to `Pentatonic`, `Exotic` and more... just choose a key, the genre and then a scale and watch my code do the rest.
My code will color-code the scale degrees and also play the scale in ascending order with a grand piano sound.

**Tech Tips**

Required packages found in the `package.json` file. 

If vite is acting weird, try running the following command in the `/var/www/gospel-gamers/gospel_gamers.github.io/knabeWebsite/newWebLook/gospel_gamers_new_website` directory: 
- `npm i -D vite @vitejs/plugin-react-refresh`
